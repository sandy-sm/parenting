================================


No child gets addicted to gadgets, They are in constant learning process.

schooling is not mandatory in todays world! Weird!

parenting is not about managing children, parenting is about managing ourselves

child vision is black and white till first 90 days.
we have to show black and white pictures in first 90 days.

0-6 years - mould
6-12 years - repair

parenting is life time commitment not 5 day journey

20/20 parenting framework

learning 20 mins, implementing 20 mins per day

90% parents is busy in creating big assets.
only 5-10% work on making child their biggest asset.

rotate clockwise with right leg up and drawing 6 by right hand 
First Slide to 19 slide -- learn from recording

sachin mindset vs vinod kambli mindset

strong mind - which is open

- story telling skill

the cup of your life - story

empty your cup and open your mind

bulb on information

jumping off the balcony seeing your child in danger -> emotional thread

how parent to why parent.
creating asset out of your child.

why you are attending parenting session ?
TODO: 

unconscious incompetence
conscious incompetence

parenting is all about interfering in taking their learning smoothly.

unconscious incompetence to consciuos incompetence.

Learning stages:-

unconscious incompetence - I do not know to drive a car
conscious incompetence   - I need to know to drive a car but can't drive
concious competence      - I can drive a car with conscious mind
unconscious competence 	 - I can drive a car with background tasks (unconscious mind)


Don't hit the panic button!
- if your child is not speaking
- worrying

negativity spreads like fire.

For every challenge/issue, there is a solution. we need to figure out.

activity 1) 
Emotional thread
-> emotional goal steps

activity 2) 
rotate clockwise with right leg up and write an imaginary 6 by right hand
let child also try

activity 3)
family dinner together.
left hand dinner (may be your child is left handed)

! every child till 6 years is left handed !
! because their right brain is pre-dominantly working in first 6 years.

encourage to be left hander, they become multi-taskers.

! weekend fun -- accomplish all our activities by left hand

Emotional thread: To see my child as +1 version of us
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 2: Subconscious parenting

sleep learn technique

concious - using all 5 senses in doing the work
subconcious mind - whatever values we inculcate in first 8 years. would be used entire life

concious - behaviour, goals, plans, methods, thorughts, analysis, strategies,logic, willpower
subconcious - feelings, intutions, imagination, identification, cultural paradigms, defence mechanism,
		perception of self, associations, creativity, beliefs, fears, tastes, patterns, habits,
		values

first data - blink and child cry - way  to communicate to you by baby

second data and first fear in newborn infant - fear of fall, if leave in bed - they give sudden jerk

third data and second fear - fear of unheard sound

learn the art of converting negativity to positivity

relieve fears, and attract positive thoughts

negative thoughts -- you are not allowed, get lost

negative people -- god bless you, I am ignoring you

new role investigation programme

don't pass on the fears to children

activity - think of fav food that your mom cooks

reading, folding, -- good habits to give your child

high value system -- 
values is one of the success principle.
that comes from home

0-2 years -> absorption age. absorps everything in environment
2-8 years -> whatever they absorp, they implement, 
		-- need to be very concious in this period


keep them happy in between 0-8 years

emotional happiness -- consciously do not fight in front of child

sort out your fights -- make your childs childhood happy..

always think on alternative word

subconsciuos mind is responsible for most things we are able to do every single day in order to survive or excel.

bulb on moment

brain wave patterns

beta state:- 12-30 hz - conscious state, alert state

> 30Hz -> anger, temperament

alpha state:- 8-12 hz - calm and relaxed

theta state:- 4-7 Hz - deep sleep state, 
	when you put baby to deep sleep, in this timing, we will use sleep learning technique

delta state:- 0.1 - 4 Hz - 


SLT: reason -> remove any bad behaviours

0-2 years -> do not use SLT for removing bad behaviours.


bad behaviour (above 2 years) - haphazard sleep patterns, bed wetting, nail biting, thumb seeking


using template -> positive sentences

using SLT to remove 1 behaviour at a time 

> 2-3 years
1) name of the child
2) loving words
3) addressing the behaviour with reasoning
4) assuring the child
5) ending with loving words


0-2 years -> using SLT for positive affirmation only 

template of message -> 
2 ways -> positive way (using positive sentences) or indirect way (no negative sentences no direct sentences)


positive way:
1) name of the child
2) loving words
3) addressing the behaviour with reasoning
4) assuring the child
5) ending with loving words


indirect way (use only for thumb seeking, bed wetting)
never address behaviour directly.. use positive words

0-2 years SLT:-

! eats well, sleeps well, learns well, plays well (0-2 years)
! you are a healthy child (whisper in sleep)


Role modeling
0-6 years - you are the role model for you child. 
child copies you 

> 6 years - friends, school 


communication 
- Listening
listen to your child, dont ignore. otherwise they will ignore you after 6 years.
active listening -> eye to eye and face to face contact

consistency
stick to your decision. yes or no
we are not buying toy because it may hurt you.. stick to this.

Day 3: Vision

=============


Genius -> common thing in genius personality.. their parents

What?

- What kind of parent I wish to be?
	=> Loving, caring, Respected by child, friendly
- What do I consider success for myself?
	=> 
- What do I consider success for child?

- What values do I wish my child to have?
	=> 
- What are my childs strength?

- What are my weaknesses/limitations?

- What challenges me the most?

- How can I overcome these challenges?




Developmental Areas

1) Physical  -- jumping corner, punching bag pillows
2) Emotional --  punching bag pillows 
3) Social    -- 0-2 years -> basic neeeds, more than 2-4 years -> safety security, more 4 years -> mingling, 4-6 -> friendship,
		more than 6 years -> they look for best friend.
		jumping corner -- Varad's jumping corner
		on cushioning on ground jump from bed.
4) Language   -- reciprocate same sound as baby child (0-2 years) 
		^ they can learn 20 language within 8 years. 
		rhythmic tones
5) Fine motor  -- finger tips movement, writing develops 
		open close bottle thread
		hold cup

6) Gross motor -- use body weight to do activity
		pushing dabba from one place to other place
7) cognitive	--	2 or more years -> put 1 empty and 1 filled glass 
						and pour into empty glass
			^ you learn more with child
			
8) art and creativity -- tearing corner - use newspaper for tearing
			2-3 years -> 1 tissue paper give it to child

9) music and movement	-- 7 songs a day
			^ music is importan for brain development
			
10) imagination -- give books of pictures
			
11) sensory development  -- keep small boxes of spices.
			let them take a smell and tag the box
			
			
priorities of a child
1) Learning, 
2) Playing, 
3) Food,
	-- First 6 months, feed
	-- after 6 months, 1 grain a week
	-- little food, more nutritious
	-- everyday same place for feeding and food 
4) Sleep

^ 0-2 years, do not allow to watch them any screen

exposure to screens dries up brain


======================================================================

Day 4:  Exploring the available resources, and the possibilities of early brain stimulation with "Use it or lost it" concept

--------------------------

> positivity requires lot of efforts, negativity is automatic

curse of yelling and felling
 belief in solomon islands
 they abuse the tree (yell) and make them fell (felling)
	tree has emotions!

1 drop of poison cannot be taken out from 1 cup milk.
we have to put more and more milk (positivity) to negate the effect and dilute it.

Activity: Catching up them doing right!

Good things go unnoticed, Appreciate and applaud them...

Count of catching up them doing wrong (1)
Count of catching up them doing right (5)
Ideal scenario: Ratio should be 1:5


Usually, romance in between couples goes in back-seat when they become parent

But, in good parenting, romantic relationship should be emphasized

Brain do not decode the meaning of dont, your child does exactly the same thing you tell dont do it


Mother -> Please don't fall 			-> they fall
Father -> Hold on the tree branch tightly 	-> they will not fall


Use positive sentences always.

SLT can be used from 0 to 60 years

Negative vs Positive sentences
No running 	-> 	walk please
No throwing	-> 	put on the floor gently
No crying	-> 	Do you need some help


Don't label your child.. e.g. You are adamant like your uncle.

Role model the characteristics of famous personality.

Dear ____, you are passionate like virat kohli
Dear ----, you are kind and humble like ratanji tata
Dear ----, you have vision of APJ Abdul kalam
Dear ----, you have physique of Ronaldo
Dear ----, you have leadership qualities like Narendra modi



100 billion brain cells

number of connection you make between brain cells. (synapses)


By 8 months, brain has about 1000 trillion nerve connections
By 10 years, this number almost reduces to half

20% possibility of genetic brain cells passed to new generation


Narrate your all day experience to your child.. 
Talk as much as possible.
You are developing neural connections of your child.


whole brain learning

left brain (logical)
	-	logical thinking
	- 	analytical thinking
	- 	rational thinking
	- 	setpattern
	-	mathematics
	-	directions
	-	fear
	- 	inhibitions

right brain (creative)
	-	creativity
	- 	emotions
	- 	problem solving
	- 	simplifying
	- 	time saving
	-	intuition
	-	instant knowing
	- 	big picture

logical brain can take you from point A to point B
creative brain can take anywhere and everywhere

every school/institutation focus on only left brain 

right brain -> 0-6 year is pre-dominant

0-6 years -> moulding
6-12 years -> repairing
12 onwards -> managing

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=======================================================================

Day 5: 
Exploring the hidden genius in your child


3 layers of foundation

1) super calculating capabilities
	- keep 1 candy in one hand and keep 5 candies in left hand
	- ask your child which one is having more candies
	- children have natural ability of counting
2) photo graphic memory
	- country flags
	- company logos
3) language acquisition ability
	- children have natural ability to learn multiple languages before they turn 7 years
	- give exposure to multiple languages.

capacity of learning goes down as you age



piggy bank

transparent piggy bank. 
put a label with your child name.
they will have sense of ownership and own the task

plant pot with your child name.
Ask your child to water it daily

fine motor skills
Delayed gratification
